# Leak protection system
The system is implemented as a group of interrelated devices (modules):
* NodeMCU head unit (ESP8266) - designed for direct control of the actuators (valves) for covering the fluid;
* wired module - wired water leakage detector;
* wireless (NRF24L01) module (STM32F030F4P6) - wireless leakage detector.

## System modules

### Head unit

### Wired sensor

### Wireless sensor
It is intended for leak detection and alarm signal transmission to the head unit.
